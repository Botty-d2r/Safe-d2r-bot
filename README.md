Quick Start
Preparing the Character
Set up game key bindings for the skills used by your build.
For Blizzard Sorceress, set the left skill to Glacial Spike or Ice Blast, and for Hammerdin, to Blessed Hammer.
Ensure you have TP and ID tomes, one stack of keys, and a key binding for the TP tome.
The Horadric Cube can be kept in the inventory or stashed.
Configure inventory slots for charms.
Running the Tool
Install Diablo II: LOD 1.13c if you havenâ€™t already.
Download the latest release or build it from source.
Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
Run the executable and follow the setup wizard.
Pickit Rules
Pickit is based on NIP files. These files should be placed in the config/{character}/pickit directory. All .nip files will be loaded, and items are picked, stashed, or sold based on the rules defined in these files.
